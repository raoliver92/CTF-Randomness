# TryHackMe - The Greenholt Phish Writeup
# Background
A Sales Executive at Greenholt PLC received an email that he didn't expect to receive from a customer. He claims that the customer never uses generic greetings such as "Good day" and didn't expect any amount of money to be transferred to his account. The email also contains an attachment that he never requested. He forwarded the email to the SOC (Security Operations Center) department for further investigation.
Investigate the email sample to determine if it is legitimate.


# Email Analysis
After opening the email into Thunderbird to view there were a few things that jumped out as suspicious including the email not matching the sender name.

1. Sender name (Mr. James Jackson) does not line up to the email it was sent from (info@mutawamarine[.]com)
1. The transaction status shows successful which means it has been completed, but comparing dates the Transaction Date/Time is later than the time of the email being received.
  1. Received: 6-10-20 05:58
  1. Transaction Time: 6-10-20 09:18
1. The file attached is made to look like a PDF but has the extension of .cab which upon further investigation is a Cabinet file similar to an archive file.
